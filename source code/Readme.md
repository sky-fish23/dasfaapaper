# Open-source Code Documentation: An Embedding-based Approach to Inconsistency-tolerant Reasoning with Inconsistent Ontologies



### The source code is divided into four parts:

- MCS generator
- MIS generator
- NaturalOWL tool
- Scoring function



**MCS generator**  is used to generate the maximal consistent subsets of inconsistent ontology. 

**MIS generator** is used to generate the minimal inconsistent subsets of inconsistent ontology.

**NaturalOWL tool** is used to translate axioms into natural language sentence forms.

**scoring function** is used to score the maximal consistent subsets using methods defined in our paper.



Detailed instructions for each part are attached to the corresponding code folder.
